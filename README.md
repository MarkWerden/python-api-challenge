# Python API Homework - What's the Weather Like? (Complete)

As usual, I attempted to explain where I can to show that I am learning from this rather than just copy-pasting. Part I observations are within its respective file, and I created a "Screenshots" folder for Part II as the assignment wanted images from the heatmap data that was created. - Mark
(P.S.: Due to how I submitted the assignment, I instead created two api key files, which are in the form of the "location files" within each folder. You may have to split up the api keys to seperate files because of it.)
